# AWS will automatically create this role on member accounts only if the member account is
# created from a master account.
# More info: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html
#
# Therefore we need to bootstrap this role in two situations:
# 1. bootstrap on master account
# 2. bootstrap on member accounts that were NOT created from the master account
#  (i.e. existing accounts brought into org-formation management)
#
# NOTE: The MasterServiceRoleArn is only required when deployed to the Master account
#
# Stack name should be 'bootstrap-cross-account-role'
